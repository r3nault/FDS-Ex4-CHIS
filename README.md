# FDS-Ex4-CHIS
Springboard: Foundations of Data Science - Exercise 4 - Data Viz - CHIS.R

# Getting Started
This R code runs in RStudio using R version 3.4.1. You need the dplyr and ggplot2 libraries installed. You need to download xxxxxxxxx.csv which is used in the code.

# Variables
The data is a subset of the California Health Information Survey (CHIS) which contains 436 variables across nearly 50,000 rows. For analysis, only ten variables have been taken and a small number of rows have been filtered to remove <5% of records based on those falling outside the four main ethnic groups. The variables retained are:
- RBMI: BMI Category description
- BMI_P: BMI value
- RACEHPR2: race
- SRSEX: sex
- SRAGE_P: age
- MARIT2: Marital status
- AB1: General Health Condition
- ASTCUR: Current Asthma Status
- AB51: Type I or Type II Diabetes
- POVLL: Poverty level
